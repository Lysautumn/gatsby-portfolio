Hello world! 

I'm so happy that I'm writing this. That means I've made it through 3 days of 100 Days of Code! This may not seem like a lot of time (and honestly, it's really not), but considering how tired I am, it was tempting to not spend time writing code today. But, building habits is great, and I'm making good progress on my website! Also, it kept me from falling asleep on the couch at 8pm, which is also a win in my book.

Today I made a contact form. Well, a very non-functional contact form. I spent a good amount of time researching documentation. I decided today to bring in Material UI in order to style the inputs for the form. I am strange in that I like fighting with styling. I may roll by eyes when I style an element with CSS and _nothing changes_, but I will view CSS as a worthy adversary and keep trying until it works. For that reason, younger Ally was resistant to things like Bootstrap and Material UI because it felt lazy. Now, wiser Ally realizes how incredibly powerful it can be to have a framework to help with styling. The consistency and relative ease of creating beautiful designs is enticing.

Tonight and tomorrow, I'm going to decide whether I really want the contact form. I'm going to provide my social links (Email, Twitter, and LinkedIn for sure), so I don't know if I really need the contact form. Still valuable learning today!
