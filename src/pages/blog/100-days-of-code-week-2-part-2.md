Hello world! 

This has been sort of a tough week. Have you ever been working on a project, and you had an idea of what you wanted it to look like in your mind? You were excited about the possibilities and couldn't wait to build it? How about the other side to that coin? You thought you knew what you wanted. You thought you knew what it would look like. You were excited to show others. And then, suddenly, things don't look how you want them to look. You don't want to show anyone and aren't sure how to proceed.

I went through some of that this week, and it took some time to regroup. On top of that, I got sick, so that took some wind out of my sails for a few days.

But, even with all of that...

My personal site is deployed! I am so happy! It took longer than I expected because I completely broke my code while trying to deploy (so I couldn't even run it locally). I asked for some help from a coworker who was familiar with GatsbyJS and Netlify (where I'm hosting), and he was able to help me figure it out. The issue I was having was a pretty easy fix (involving caching old builds). It's so gratifying to see my work online and let people look at it. There are still some tweaks that I need to work on, but that will happen in time. 

Today I also figured out how to add icons to my site. I was using [Linearicons](https://www.linearicons.com), and then decided to switch to [React-Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons), an npm package that includes icons from multiple different sources, including Font Awesome and Material Design Icons. By using an npm package, it was much easier to include the icons in the components where I wanted to use them. It was fun to figure out what icons to use and how to style them correctly.

I'm also in planning mode on my emotion tracking app. I generally spend some time planning projects before I start them (when I can). I like to organize myself and have a rough roadmap of where I am headed. It helps me break things down into small pieces and know what things I want to research before proceeding.
