Hello world! 

As you can see from the date of this post, I took a break yesterday. From this project anyway. After taking a sick day on Monday, I had work pile up that needed to get done. And, I still wasn't feeling great, so I worked from home. By the time my work day was done, my brain was tired. Instead of being hard on myself or disappointed that my streak of writing code every day lasted 9 days, I let myself rest. I'm glad I did! I am finally feeling a little better. At least well enough to go back to work.

Today, I worked on some code in anticipation of the next project I'm going to be working on! Once my personal site is deployed, I will be ready to move onto the next thing. I will of course still maintain this site, but I'm ready to work on a new project.

When I was a young kid, I would ride my bike to a nearby corner store with my parents. They would bring me to the candy aisle and tell me I could pick something out. I would become paralyzed. There were _so many_ options! I couldn't choose between fruit flavored candy or chocolate, or all of the available options within those categories. I would stare at the wall. Eventually, my parents would tell me I had until the count of 10 to make a choice. There was at least one time when I didn't make a choice by the time they counted down. That "Analysis Paralysis" still exists in me sometimes, but not nearly as bad as it used to. One of the main ways that it shows up in my life now is when I start deciding on what personal project I want to work on.

I currently have a list of projects I want to work on, the hard part is picking one! I think I've narrowed it down, though, which is really exciting! I think the next thing I'm going to work on is a mindfulness app where a user can track their emotions, reflect on the day, and see a visual representation of their emotions over time. Checking in with myself and my emotional responses is something that I do frequently, and being able to have a way to keep track of it and visualize it would be really fun! It will allow me to explore authentication (I'm used to Passport and have done Firebase as well), and data visualization! I think I'm going to try my hand at a Rails backend as well.
