excerpt: "Analysis paralysis and what comes next"

Hello world! 

Today, I worked on some code in anticipation of the next project I'm going to be working on! Once my personal site is "done", I will be ready to move onto the next thing. I say "done" because I know I'm going to have a list of things I want to add or improve. I will of course still maintain this site, but I'm ready to work on a new project. 

When I was a young kid, I would ride my bike to a nearby corner store with my parents. They would bring me to the candy aisle and tell me I could pick something out. I would become paralyzed. There were _so many_ options! I couldn't choose between fruit flavored candy or chocolate, or all of the available options within those categories. I would stare at the wall. Eventually, my parents would tell me I had until the count of 10 to make a choice. There was at least one time when I didn't make a choice by the time they counted down. That "Analysis Paralysis" still exists in me sometimes, but not nearly as bad as it used to. One of the main ways that it shows up in my life now is when I start deciding on what personal project I want to work on.

I currently have a list of projects I want to work on, the hard part is picking one! I think I've narrowed it down, though, which is really exciting! I think the next thing I'm going to work on is a mindfulness app where a user can track their emotions, reflect on the day, and see a visual representation of their emotions over time. Checking in with myself and my emotional responses is something that I do frequently, and being able to have a way to keep track of it and visualize it would be really fun! It will allow me to explore authentication (I'm used to Passport and have done Firebase as well), and data visualization! I think I'm going to try my hand at a Rails backend as well.

I had a consult with a coworker last week who works in User Experience. I had her take a look at my personal site and help me come up with ways to make sure it was conveying the message I want it to convey. I don't get to spend as much time working with my UX coworkers as I would like, so it was nice to spend a little time talking through design choices and details I had initially overlooked. There were many cases where there were details I was not happy with, but unsure of how to change it, and she was able to provide some clarity.

I really love the blend of design and development. In my free time, I've been learning visual design. It's something I've always been interested in. My mom went to school for graphic design when I was a kid, so I've kind of always thought about how things are designed and how to make them better. Having the opportunity to work with both developers and designers at my current job has really been great for adding perspective to my work and helped me find opportunities to learn and grow.
