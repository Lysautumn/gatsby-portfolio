Hello world! 

I'm getting sick. I made it through the winter without getting super sick, and now that it's getting nice out, I'm sick! I thought it was just allergies, but now I'm not so sure. This has made it a little harder to focus on learning and building things because I'm tired and come home from work ready to sleep.

Today, I was supposed to go see _Hello Dolly_ at the Orpheum in Minneapolis with a friend of mine. I had to give him my ticket because of how I'm feeling. Such a bummer, I was really excited. _Hello Dolly_ is one of the shows that season ticket holders of Hennepin Theater Trust's "Broadway on Hennepin" program get to see. My husband and I bought season tickets so we could see _Hamilton_. Which was incredible, even though we had some of the worst seats in the house. If you want to see a picture of our view of the stage, check out my About Me page. We also got to see _Book of Mormon_. We still have a couple awesome shows left in the season. Since we met in theatre in high school, it's been fitting to go see shows together.

I've been working on my redesign. I'm trying to not get overwhelmed by all the things I can do, and just keep moving forward. When I have it deployed, I can keep refining it. The one "nice" thing about being sick on the weekend is that I have some time to work on code and don't really need to think about all the other things I could be doing (like grocery shopping or cleaning).
