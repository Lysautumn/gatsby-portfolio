Hello world! 

My personal site is deployed! I am so happy! The issue I was having was a pretty easy fix (involving caching old builds). It's so gratifying to see my work online and having people look at it. There are still some tweaks that I need to work on, but that will happen in time. 

Today I also figured out how to add icons to my site. I was using [Linearicons](https://www.linearicons.com), and then decided to switch to [React-Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons), an npm package that includes icons from multiple different sources, including Font Awesome and Material Design Icons. By using an npm package, it was much easier to include the icons in the components where I wanted to use them. It was fun to figure out what icons to use and how to style them correctly.

I'm also in planning mode on my emotion tracking app. I generally spend some time planning projects before I start them (when I can). I like to organize myself and have a rough roadmap of where I am headed. It helps me break things down into small pieces and know what things I want to research before proceeding.
