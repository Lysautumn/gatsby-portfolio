Hello world! 

I honestly believe that it's important to try not to be too hard on yourself. This has been a hard thing for me to learn, even though it's something that I spend a lot of time talking with students about. This is true in many things in life, include learning to code. I think the first time I experienced Imposter Syndrome was when I was a student at Prime. Prior to attending Prime, many things came rather easy for me. I did well in school, and didn't always need to apply myself in order to do so. Once I started learning to code, this wasn't always the case.

I spent a lot of time while learning to code comparing myself to others. It can be easy to get disheartened if people around you pick up a concept easier than you did, or if they find a more elegant solution to solve a problem, or get their first tech job before you. The challenge is to keep going. Today, this is a reminder I have needed to give myself.
