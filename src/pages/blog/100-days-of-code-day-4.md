Hello world! 

Today was a weird coding day for me. I went to a local Starbucks to do my daily commits. This is not a new thing for me, it's something I used to do all the time when I was working on my undergraduate and graduate degrees. Since becoming an engineer, it's something I've honestly done less often. So it was nice to do something so familiar. That is, until I tried to connect to the internet. It would not connect. I tried _everything_... Nothing worked. So, I had to fly blind and code without Google! 

I am fortunate that I learned to code in a time where Google is available, it's incredibly valuable. Being able to have documentation on everything is so useful and is something I know I take for granted. It was actually kind of nice to have to rely on my own knowledge. It really made me feel more confident. Unfortunately, trying to connect to the internet cut into the time I had at Starbucks, but I still worked on things.

The sad thing is, the stuff I worked on ended up being removed. I was planning on creating a replica of my resume on my personal site. It feels too text-heavy, though, and doesn't really follow what I am wanting from my site. I want to find a more creative way to talk about all of the things I've done and the skills I've picked up along the way. 

This is something I will have to come back to another day!
