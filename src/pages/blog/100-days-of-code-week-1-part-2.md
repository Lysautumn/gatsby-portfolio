Hello world!

I've been spending the first part of the 100 days of code learning GatsbyJS. There are a few things I've really liked about learning it:

- I've learned more about React and how it works. I was lucky enough to learn React from some coworkers, but also had to learn quite a bit of it on my own. Somehow in my learning process I missed some concepts on how React is working, and it's been nice to fill in some of those gaps.

- The main reason I've wanted to pick up GatsbyJS is to be able to create pages from markdown files (which I've been using to write this blog). There are some really cool use cases for this feature, especially in terms of making static sites easier for people who don't know HTML and CSS to update.

- In order to generate static pages with markdown, you need to use GraphQL. I did not know GraphQL before working on this project. There was a little bit of a learning curve on how to get my queries to work correctly, but now that I have them pulling in the correct information, I can see how truly powerful it is! There is still so much more I can learn about GraphQL, and I'm hoping to dig into it more in the future.

This challenge in general has been really great, because I've been able to stretch my skills and find new ways to solve problems. Earlier this week, I went to a local Starbucks to work on things, and the internet wasn't working! I tried _everything_ to get my computer connected, and nothing worked. So, I had to fly blind and code without Google! 

I am fortunate that I learned to code in a time where Google is available, it's incredibly valuable. Being able to have documentation on everything is so useful and is something I know I take for granted. It was actually kind of nice to have to rely on my own knowledge. It really made me feel more confident. Unfortunately, trying to connect to the internet cut into the time I had at Starbucks, but I still worked on things.
