Hello world!

Somehow, when I installed things to use Rails, I broke Node. I spend a lot of my time running Node servers locally, and I currently can't. I've been wanting to get screenshots of other projects I've built for my personal site, but I can't get them to run. This has been one of those interesting problems where I know the answer is in the Google search results _somewhere_, but I need to wade through a lot of things to find it.

Until then, my building has been limited to online tutorial work. I recently brushed up on my Ruby with Codecademy's Ruby course. Now, I'm working through the Ruby on Rails course in order to get some familiarity with the syntax before building something with it. Spending a lot of time with tutorials isn't really where I want to spend my time, but it's better than doing nothing, right?

I'm excited to build something with Rails because I'm used to using Node/Express for my backend, and I think it would be great to be familiar with another option. I spend more of my time working on the front end, so learning more about the backend will be a unique challenge.
