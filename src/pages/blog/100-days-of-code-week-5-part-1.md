Hello world!

Even though my personal site is deployed and available for others to view, I haven't shared it with many people. It's something I've been a little afraid to show to people. The main reason for this is because it requires a little bit of vulnerablility. This is something that I'm pretty proud of and have been working on for a few weeks. I love getting feedback and this is a great opportunity to get some, so I'm going to need to let people look at it, right?

I'm really proud that I was able to figure out how to create these blog posts using markdown. GraphQL is still a little bit of a mystery to me. I really want to dig into it more in a future assignment, but for now, I know how to pull information from these markdown files to get each post to display correctly. Being able to use some templating in React could be really powerful, and I could think of some really great use cases for this. It's also much easier to maintain than a bunch of HTML files. I love HTML, and there are definite limitations to what I can do with markdown, but for this, it's been perfect.

If I were to do this project again, I think I would work to get less caught up in details and really think through what features I want. I wasted a lot of time getting distracted and derailed because I wasn't very clear from the start. Sometimes, being able change gears is a great strength to have, and I think in the end it made this a better project. But, it definitely was much slower going than I would have liked.

Now, onto my next project!
