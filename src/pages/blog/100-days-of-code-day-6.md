Hello world! 

Today has been a bit of a long day for me. This week at work, I am doing one on ones with each of the students I am currently working with. These one on ones are a great opportunity to get to know each individual more and find out ways that I can support them. It's also a drain on my introverted self.

I used to be much more introverted than I am now. I definitely still don't get energy from being in groups of people, and public speaking makes my stomach go in knots, but I can do it. When I was a student at Prime, we practiced public speaking a few times a week. At first, it was terrifying. I didn't want to get up to speak, I relied heavily on notes, I was noticeably uncomfortable. And then, the more I did it, the easier it got. By the end of Prime, I presented with a group in front of ~200 people, and it went ok! Now, I talk in front of people all the time! If someone had told me a few years ago that I would be able to talk in front of groups without completely losing it, I wouldn't have believed it. I'm still uncomfortable, it's still not my favorite things, but I can do it. That's the kind of growth I'm always striving for.

Now, with 100 Days of Code, I'm trying to grow in a different way. It's still uncomfortable and can be terrifying, but it's also one of the most exciting things. I get to work on projects, celebrate wins, and learn so much along the way. The fun thing about tech is that the limits feel just about endless. And the field is growing so fast, it's impossible to learn it all. But, it's a great kind of freedom to be able to try to do something and then DO it! Also, just like public speaking, the more I do it, the easier it gets.

Today, I am working on my About page. It's weird trying to condense who I am and what I'm interested in into one page.
