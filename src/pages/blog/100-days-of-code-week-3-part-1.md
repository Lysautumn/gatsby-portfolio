Hello world!

Yesterday, I went to Minnebar at Best Buy HQ. It's my favorite conference, and I had a lot of fun this year! I went to some really good sessions, and connected with friends. It's really fun to be around such great energy and have the opportunity to learn about things I may not otherwise dig into.

One of my favorite sessions was about designing products with mental health in mind by Madelin Snyder. It was really interesting to talk about how many of the apps we use today are designed in such a way that we are sucked in. Apps encourage us to continue to scroll, whether we have seen the content already or not. Thinking of ways to allow a user to "unplug" is something I'm really interested in exploring, even if I never create the next great social networking app.

I'm still working on getting everything set up so I can start learning Rails. There were a lot of things I needed to download and update, which always takes a lot of time. I'm excited to dig in!
Hello world! 

A funny story: My husband had some friends over for a game night. I didn't play games because I wasn't really feeling up to it, and worked on code instead. I spent almost an hour working on conditionally rendering a button and finding a better way to display blog posts. At one point, I got super excited about getting the button to work correctly. One of our friends, who is also an engineer, asked me what was so exciting. In an attempt to summarize what I had done, I said, "I got a button to disappear!". That led to a conversation on how people who don't work in tech don't always realize the amount of effort that goes into things that they take for granted. 

What ended up working to make the list of posts to display how I want is that I decided I wanted to show the four most recent posts, and then show another 4 each time the "show more" button is clicked. I had to use `.slice` on the array of posts to get that working. Then, I wanted to have the button disappear when all posts are displayed. Conditional rendering made that possible, and once I got it working as expected, it was such a great feeling! Getting a "show more" button to disappear when everything is displayed can actually take some time and effort, but it sounds so easy when you just say "I got a button to disappear"!

I'm sure some people think making a great latte is easy too, but my years as a barista taught me otherwise.
