excerpt: "Showing my personality"
---

Hello world!

One of the main pieces of feedback I got from my colleague when we met is that I should add in more of my personality to my site. I definitely have a personality, and have so many interests outside of technology, but it's always been hard for me to get those interests on "paper". 

I've been working to add in more of my personality to the site. One thing I was able to talk about is my love of seeing plays/musicals/shows. I don't actually go to shows terribly often, but I really like it when I do. I did theatre in high school, which many find surprising because I'm relatively quiet and introverted. I really loved getting to play a character and all of the effort that went into preparing for a show. And, actually, the shows themselves weren't too bad, mostly because it's really hard to see how many people are watching when the lights are dimmed. This past year, I was able to see _Hamilton_ and _Book of Mormon_! Being able to see _Hamilton_ in particular was incredible. 

I think adding some personality into my personal site was a great challenge, and I'm glad that I did it.

I was able to fix Node on my computer, which is great because it was taking a lot of time away from other things I wanted to do. Not only was it hard because I couldn't run a server locally, but it was also distracting! I spent a lot of brain power thinking about how I could possibly solve the problem. Now that it's fixed, I can do my work more effectively, and run the servers for my side projects as well!
