Hello world! 

Today is day 2 of my 100 days of code! I am determined to do this 100 day challenge, even though sometimes it can be hard to find time! When I think about it though, it's really only asking for 1 hour a day, and I can find time for that. Today is the premiere of the last season of Game of Thrones, so I needed to make sure to get my time in before the show starts!

We have a group of friends who have been coming over to watch Game of Thrones with us for the last couple years, so we're celebrating the premiere with good friends and good food tonight!

I've been spending the first part of the 100 days of code learning GatsbyJS. There are a few things I've really liked about learning it:

- I've learned more about React and how it works. I was lucky enough to learn React from some coworkers, but also had to learn quite a bit of it on my own. Somehow in my learning process I missed some concepts on how React is working, and it's been nice to fill in some of those gaps.

- The main reason I've wanted to pick up GatsbyJS is to be able to create pages from markdown files (which I've been using to write this blog). There are some really cool use cases for this feature, especially in terms of making static sites easier for people who don't know HTML and CSS to update.

- In order to generate static pages with markdown, you need to use GraphQL. I did not know GraphQL before working on this project. There was a little bit of a learning curve on how to get my queries to work correctly, but now that I have them pulling in the correct information, I can see how truly powerful it is! There is still so much more I can learn about GraphQL, and I'm hoping to dig into it more in the future.

I'm excited for the things I am planning on working on tomorrow!
