Hello world! 

Have you ever been working on a project, and you had an idea of what you wanted it to look like in your mind? You were excited about the possibilities and couldn't wait to build it? How about the other side to that coin? You thought you knew what you wanted. You thought you knew what it would look like. You were excited to show others. And then, suddenly, things don't look how you want them to look. You don't want to show anyone and aren't sure how to proceed.

That's where I am. I've had to make some choices to move away from my original design due to some logistical problems. I settled on a new design that I didn't like as much, but was working. Now, maybe because I've been looking at it for so long, I don't think I like it anymore. It's coming down to not just design decisions but also questions of whether the site is representing me in a way that I want. I know this is a *huge* question, but one that is hard to ignore when working on something so close to me.

Today, I took some time to talk to people and regroup. I landed on a new design that I like more, and I'm going to start there and see how far I get. I think from here I'm going to work on getting the site complete before choosing to change anything else. I think I have a great roadmap from here and want to have a finished product, even if I have a list of things I want to change from there.
