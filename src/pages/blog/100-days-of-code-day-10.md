Hello world! 

Well, I am definitely sick. I was feeling quite a bit better yesterday, so I was hoping that it was done, but it's not... So, I took the day off to rest and relax. I'm hoping that taking the day will be all that I need.

Today, I did some final touch ups on the site before starting the deploy process. It's been a couple years since I had a personal site. Actually, the last time I had one was before I went to Prime. Before going to Prime, I did another program called Skillcrush. It's an online program, and I had a lot of fun with it. It's where I learned Ruby, which is still my favorite programming language. 

When the .dev domains became available a few weeks ago, I snapped mine up! It was a great push to get me to build something to put online. But, since it's been so long since I've done it outside of work, it's been really overwhelming. I decided to host on Netlify, because I had heard great things about it. When I tried to build, however, it totally broke. Long story short, I currently can't run my site locally either. I know it's probably something really small, but it's definitely frustrating.

This has been a really good exercise for me in terms of practicing self care and taking breaks when I get frustrated. I would love to push through and get it working, but it will happen more smoothly if I approach it from a less frustrated mindset. So, I'll come back to it tomorrow!
