Hello world! 

This is my first post in my series on my [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge. To start, a little about myself and the challenge!

My name is Ally, I am a Software Engineer in Minneapolis, MN! I started to dabble in code about 4 years ago, when a friend recommended I learn it. I was unhappy in my job at the time and looking for something fun, creative and challenging. Eventually, I was laid off from my job and was able to attend [Prime Digital Academy](https://primeacademy.io/) to learn full stack software engineering. After working in the field for a little while, I was offered the opportunity to come back to Prime to work as a member of the faculty! There, I am able to teach and mentor new engineers as they are entering this field. I am passionate about increasing equity and representation in tech, and making it a diverse and welcoming place for all. 

Since I have been in my role for almost a year and a half, I have recently started to feel more comfortable in my role, which is great, but I've been looking for ways to continue to learn and grow. I have never been really great at working on side projects. It's not that I'm not interested in writing code when I'm not working, it's more a "kid in the candy aisle" feeling. There is so much to learn, so many projects I want to build, and it's _overwhelming_. So, rather than spend more time not writing code while I try to decide on which project to build, I'm going to just jump in!

That's where 100 Days of Code comes in. The 100 Days of Code challenge is to write code for at least one hour every day. It also asks you to tweet about what you're working on and encourage others. I'm using this 100 days to work on a couple projects and trying a few things out that have been on my To Do list (and yes, building a To Do list is on my To Do list!). I'm starting with GatsbyJS. This site has been built in Gatsby, and I am using it to programmatically create these blog posts from Markdown files! So cool!

Today (actually yesterday, I am finishing this on 4/14), I spent my time writing some code to clean up my personal site. Somehow, in the excitement of writing code and working on something... I forgot to commit. It's funny to me when the good habits I work to instill in my students (commit often, take breaks, ask for help, etc) are the pitfalls I encounter as well. Luckily, I didn't lose any work!
