Hello world! 

A funny story from yesterday: My husband had some friends over for a game night. I didn't play games because I wasn't really feeling up to it, and worked on code instead. I spent almost an hour working on conditionally rendering a button and finding a better way to display blog posts. At one point, I got super excited about getting the button to work correctly. One of our friends, who is also an engineer, asked me what was so exciting. In an attempt to summarize what I had done, I said, "I got a button to disappear!". That led to a conversation on how people who don't work in tech don't always realize the amount of effort that goes into things that they take for granted. Getting a "show more" button to disappear when everything is displayed can actually take some time and effort, but it sounds so easy!

I'm sure some people think making a great latte is easy too, but my years as a barista taught me otherwise.

Tonight is the second episode of Game of Thrones, which I will definitely be watching. Now that I have my button conditionally rendering, I am working on refining the "show more" functionality. Once it's done, I will be ready to start on the deploy process! Woohoo!
