Hello world! 

A funny story from yesterday: My husband had some friends over for a game night. I didn't play games because I wasn't really feeling up to it, and worked on code instead. I spent almost an hour working on conditionally rendering a button and finding a better way to display blog posts. At one point, I got super excited about getting the button to work correctly. One of our friends, who is also an engineer, asked me what was so exciting. In an attempt to summarize what I had done, I said, "I got a button to disappear!". That led to a conversation on how people who don't work in tech don't always realize the amount of effort that goes into things that they take for granted. 

What ended up working to make the list of posts to display how I want is that I decided I wanted to show the four most recent posts, and then show another 4 each time the "show more" button is clicked. I had to use `.slice` on the array of posts to get that working. Then, I wanted to have the button disappear when all posts are displayed. Conditional rendering made that possible, and once I got it working as expected, it was such a great feeling! Getting a "show more" button to disappear when everything is displayed can actually take some time and effort, but it sounds so easy when you just say "I got a button to disappear"!

I'm sure some people think making a great latte is easy too, but my years as a barista taught me otherwise.

Tonight is the second episode of Game of Thrones, which I will definitely be watching. Now that I have my button conditionally rendering, I am working on refining the "show more" functionality. Once it's done, I will be ready to start on the deploy process! Woohoo!
